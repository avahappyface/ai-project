**Topics:**

- Naive Bayes – A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem with the assumption of conditional independence between features.
- Logistic Regression – A linear model for binary or multiclass classification that uses the logistic (sigmoid/softmax) function to output probabilities.
- Decision Tree – A tree-structured model that splits data by features to form rules, leading to interpretable classification or regression results.
- Softmax Function – A mathematical function that converts raw scores (logits) into a probability distribution over classes.
- Adam Optimizer – A popular gradient-based optimization algorithm combining momentum and adaptive learning rates for efficient training of deep models.
